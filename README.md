## Technical Stack

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Semantic structure and custom glassmorphism effects.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first framework for rapid, responsive UI development.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JS for core logic (navigation, dynamic animation delays, and scroll handling).
* **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** Library used for smooth, reveal-on-scroll animations.
* **FontAwesome:** Iconography for technical skills and social links.

## Key Features

* **Responsive Navigation:** A custom mobile menu that transforms the navbar into a full-screen overlay with staggered link animations.
* **Interactive Project Gallery:** A horizontal, touch-friendly scroll container with smooth-behavior control buttons.
* **Dynamic Animation Engine:** Custom JavaScript logic (`applyDynamicDelays`) that automatically calculates staggered AOS delays for cards to ensure a polished entrance.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Advanced CSS backdrop-filters and gradients used for a modern "glass" aesthetic on project cards.
